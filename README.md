# Andrew Dowell
I've had a varied work life; I studied photography for five years and worked for two, was a banker for two years and a self employed analyst for one.  I'm pretty quick at learning new stuff; I went from knowing nothing about web development three months ago to being pretty proficient at it.  I also like solving problems; at my last place of work I completely automated two people's jobs.  

I've had my head in the dirt of ones and zeroes for the past three months on Makers Academy to emerge expectedly unemployed, but keen as ever to better my coding skills.  I'm looking to work with someone who is going to help me develop and be the best that I can.  In return I'll give you my all my effort to make you the best you can.

## Skills

#### Web Development

Having just completed the intensive Makers Academy course I feel like I've taken the first of many steps in my new career.  I've gone from having a very basic understanding of coding to feeling comfortable taking on anything (as long as I can use Google!). The course has taught me the best practices of coding and has reinforced that this is the career for me.  We covered JavaScript and Ruby all written with TDD in mind, and used some popular frameworks such as Rails, jQuery and Angular.

Here are some of the projects I completed on the course.
- [chitter](http://chitter-andy.herokuapp.com/): *a weekend project creating an twitter-like application*
- [TripShare](http://tripshare-frontend.herokuapp.com/): *a trip planning application made collaboration with three other students*
- [BandsNearU](https://bandsnearu.herokuapp.com/): *a music discovery web application made in collaboration with three other students*

#### Analyst
Prior to starting at Makers Academy I was the sole person to design, development and maintain reports for monitoring the production of circa 100 employees, reporting to Deloitte Senior Management.  I moved onto the role with no knowledge of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and everything was manually input to spreadsheets.  I taught myself VBA within weeks with no prior programming experience and completely automated the reports.  By the time I had left, reports which took a full day for two people to complete were done by myself within an hour.

#### Photography
For two years following my degree I was working between many jobs as a freelance photographer, photographers assistant and retoucher.  The photography life didn't work out well for me but it did give me a good working knowledge of Photoshop; which I will be more than capable to employ in any web development work.
