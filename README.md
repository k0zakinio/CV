Some blurb about me

## Skills

#### Web Development

Having just completed the intensive Makers Academy course, I feel like I've taken the first of many steps in my new career.  Before I started I had a basic understanding of coding, the course has allowed me to learn the best practices of coding and the course has reinforced that this is the career for me!  We covered JavaScript and Ruby, plus some popular frameworks such as Rails and Angular.

Here are some of the projects I completed on the course.
- [chitter](http://chitter-andy.herokuapp.com/): *a weekend project creating an twitter-like application*
- [TripShare](http://tripshare-frontend.herokuapp.com/): *a trip planning application made collaboration with three other students*
- [BandsNearU](https://github.com/k0zakinio/BandsNearU): *a music discovery web application made in collaboration with three other students*

#### Photography
For two years following my degree I was working between many jobs as a freelance photographer, photographers assistant and retoucher.  The photography life didn't work out for me but I have some good knowledge of Photoshop from this time which I intend to employ in my web development work.
